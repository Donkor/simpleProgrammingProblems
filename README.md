----------

1 Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen. <b>(helloworld.rb)</b>

2 Write a program that asks the user for his name and greets him with his name. <b>(greeter.rb)</b>

3-Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n <b>(sumOfNumbers.rb)</b>

4-Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or 
five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17 <b>(multiples.rb)<b>

5-Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives 
	him the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n. <b>(choice.rb)</b>

6-Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.<b>(multiplicationTable.rb)</b>

7-Write a program that prints all prime numbers. 
(Note: if your programming language does not support arbitrary size numbers, 
printing all primes up to the largest number you can represent is fine too.) <b>(prime.rb)</b>

8-Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. 
After every guess the program tells the user whether his number was too large or too small.
At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. 
I counts only as one try if the user inputs the same number consecutively.	<b>(guessingGame.rb)</b>

9-Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years. <b>(leap.rb)</b>

10 -Write a program that computes
4⋅∑k=1106(-1)k+12k-1=4⋅(1-1/3+1/5-1/7+1/9-1/11…).  <b>(pi.rb)</b>
