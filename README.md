4-Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or 
five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17 <b>(multiples.rb)<b>

5-Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives 
	him the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n. <b>(choice.rb)</b>

6-Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.<b>(multiplicationTable.rb)</b>

7-beginWrite a program that prints all prime numbers.
